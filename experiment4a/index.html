                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Infinite Worlds is an assignment for 147. I had to do this for a grade</p>
                    
                    <p>There is a map of a grassy plains because I used it for other map generations, but it contains a moving train going infinitely across the world. </p>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilize a system to get colors generated via noise, and have the train move based on the time since the beginning. It moves across the J axis as each second = 1 j. the randomization in the world comes from the random train stations that will occur. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The train was a pain to make since apparently my brain is small and useless and I couldn't figure out how to move it without causing a spasm. It took more than I'd like to admit. </p>
