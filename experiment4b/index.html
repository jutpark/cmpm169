                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I made a silly little forest. Despite the ordering this was the first of the 3 and its where I figured out how the coloring works. I wanted to add a source of interaction so in the forest campus with the greys to represent buildings and the browns to represent dirt, we have students you can place. </p>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used p5.js to create stick figures out of the original yellow dot. They represent students roaming the campus. I also made it more rare to see non-green colors since we're looking at UCSC from a more top down view. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was a modified version of the professors but it helped as a starting point for minecraft and train.</p>
