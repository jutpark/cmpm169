                    <p>Creeper?
						Aww, man
						So we back in the mine
						Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
						Side-side to side
						This task, a grueling one
						Hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
						Diamonds tonight
						Heads up
						You hear a sound, turn around and look up
						Total shock fills your body
						Oh, no, it's you again
						I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes
						Eyes-eye-eyes
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again
						And run, run until it's done, done
						Until the sun comes up in the morning
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						Just when you think you're safe
						Overhear some hissing from right behind
						Right-right behind
						That's a nice life you have
						Shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time
						Time-time-time-time
						Blows up
						Then your health bar drops and you could use a one-up
						Get inside, don't be tardy
						So, now you're stuck in there
						Half a heart is left, but don't die, die, die
						Die-die-die
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again
						And run, run until it's done, done
						Until the sun comes up in the morning
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
						And make some armor, get it, baby
						Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
						The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me, bro, huh
						Training in your room under the torchlight
						Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
						Every single day and the whole night
						Creeper's out prowlin', hoo, alright
						Look at me, look at you
						Take my revenge, that's what I'm gonna do
						I'm a warrior, baby, what else is new?
						And my blade's gonna tear through you, bring it
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						(Gather your stuff, yeah, let's take back the world)
						Yeah, baby, tonight
						Grab your sword, armor and go (it's on)
						Take your revenge (whoa), oh-oh, oh-oh
						So fight, fight, like it's the last, last night
						Of your life, life, show them your bite (whoa)
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						You grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
						And run, run until it's done, done
						Until the sun comes up in the morn'
						'Cause, baby, tonight (c'mon, swing your sword up high, c'mon)
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (swing your sword up, oh)</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The world generation was very simple and similar to the forest BUT I made it so that it loops through a mining sequence when you click on a block. My friend also demonstrated TTP https://youtu.be/KzBpAYbib0c?si=5fjXBsBalmZGGKKZ </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm very happy with this one because I got to post the revenge lyrics and it being relevant. </p>
